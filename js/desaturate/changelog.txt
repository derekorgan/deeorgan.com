 Delay canvas generation. It's allow to use .desaturate() in any part on document without
   'onload' image attribute. Check example3.html.
 New option 'onchange'. It's callback called after image switched to gray. This can be usefull for
   Chrome/Firefox because real desaturate happens only after image loaded. Check example3.html.
 Known bugs: in Chrome (and may be some other) chain is broken, so $('IMG').desaturate().fadeOut(5000)
   will not work. Please, use 'onchange' callback.

 Support images which currently hided (display:none) and have no size. Width and height attributes not
 work correctly. For cross-browser solution you need to add inline style="width:XXXpx; height:XXXpx;".
